        <div class="song-detail-text">Danceability</div>
        <div class="fun-fact">
          Songs that make people move have a higher chance of making it to the
          top 50 charts. Crafting rhythms and beats that compel listeners to
          groove increases the track's potential for broader appeal and radio
          play.

      <div class="song-detail">
        <div class="song-detail-number">{{ audio_features['energy'] }}</div>
        <div class="song-detail-text">Energy</div>
        <div class="fun-fact">
          Tracks with high energy levels tend to capture attention and stand
          out. Artists focusing on injecting dynamic, lively elements into their
          music might find their way into the top 50 as these songs often
          resonate more with the audience.

        <div class="song-detail-text">Key</div>
        <div class="fun-fact">
          Interestingly, certain keys have historically had better reception
          among listeners. Exploring different keys and their emotional impact
          could influence the overall feel of a track and potentially improve
          its chances of chart success.

        <div class="song-detail-text">Loudness</div>
        <div class="fun-fact">
          Louder tracks tend to make a stronger impact on listeners. Striking
          the right balance between being attention-grabbing and maintaining
          quality is key to making a mark in the competitive music landscape and
          reaching the top 50.

        <div class="song-detail-text">Mode</div>
        <div class="fun-fact">
          Songs in a major mode often connect better with larger audiences.
          Artists might consider the emotional undertones of major keys when
          aiming for a broader listener base and a higher chance of charting.

        <div class="song-detail-text">Speechiness</div>
        <div class="fun-fact">
          Incorporating spoken words in a track can add an intriguing dimension.
          Finding the right blend of sung and spoken elements could create a
          unique sonic experience, potentially captivating audiences and aiding
          in chart placement.

      <div class="song-detail">

        </div>
        <div class="song-detail-text">Acousticness</div>
        <div class="fun-fact">
          While acoustic songs have their charm, the charts often favor tracks
          with fewer acoustic elements. Artists exploring a blend of acoustic
          and electronic sounds might align better with current listener trends
          and increase their chances of charting.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="song-detail">
        <div class="song-detail-number">
          {{ audio_features['instrumentalness'] }}
        </div>
        <div class="song-detail-text">Instrumentalness</div>
        <div class="fun-fact">
          Balancing vocals and instrumental elements is crucial. Songs with a
          balanced mix often appeal to a wider audience, potentially increasing
          the track's chances of climbing the charts and gaining popularity.

        <div class="song-detail-text">Liveness</div>
        <div class="fun-fact">
          Surprisingly, the presence of audience recordings doesn't
          significantly impact a track's chart performance. Artists might focus
          more on other attributes to create a standout piece rather than solely
          emphasizing audience participation for chart success.
